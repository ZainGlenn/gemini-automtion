## Usage with IDE (IntelliJ)

* Download and install IntelliJ.
* Navigate to plugins and install plugin Gauge
* Open project
    * Let Gradle download dependencies and index project
    * build project to ensure project can compile
* create dir in env folder with java.properties inside created folder see other env folders for naming convention
* Folder : src/test/java/resources refactor copy property file eg. default.properties and rename according to convention
* specs/*.spec are the execution files if plugin installed successfully then play buttons are located next to each specification and markdowns are applied
* to quickly create a run configuration click play inside a spec file a failure is expected to resolve edit the run configuration and add a program argument
    ```
    --env {envFolderName eg. default}
    ```
* Run again and specification should run


## Running without IDE

* open terminal
* cd to directory of project
* run command
    ```
    ./gradlew clean build gauge -Penv="default"
    ```
